# "Jimmy Jab Trivia"
- A Brooklyn 99 themed trivia game

The user will attempt to answer 5 questions about the tv show. If they answer 3 out of 5 correctly, they win. 

1. The using will land on the Welcome page. The page will include an image, the triva name, a short description and a "start game button" 
2. Once the user pushes the button, they will be led to a second page where the first question will pop up. There will be 4 choices. 
3 If the user, chooses the correct anser, a "correct answer' message will pop up. If the user chooses the wrong anser, a "wrong anser image will pop up
4. The score will be kept track of in the top left corner of the screen. It will flucuate depending on how they do. 
5. After each queston, the user will press "next question" and the question will pop up from the bottom. 
6. Once the user gets through all 5 of the questions, they will be taken to a results page where they will see if they have won or lost. there will be a "play again button and a "return home" button 
note: I understand this will require 3 HTML files and I've already thought about how to loop the questions and ansers into an object. I am feeling much more comfortable with the material after this weekend.
