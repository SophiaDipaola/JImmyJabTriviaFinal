### Overview

To get your project idea approved for the Unit 1 project, you will begin developing your project's README file. The approval process will follow the steps below:

* Learn about README files and markdown
* Fork and clone this README for your project
* In your copy, fill out the following fields:
  * Title & Blurb
  * Motivation
  * User Stories & Wireframes
* Submit a pull request for project approval
* Get your project approved
* Copy this template to your project repository
* Complete your README as your project develops


### What is a README?

A README is a file that describes a project, program or app. It often includes information on technologies used, how to install or use the app, and code examples.

On GitHub, a README in your repo acts like an `index.html` file. If there is a README in a directory of a repo, the README will display as an HTML page.

### Markdown

Markdown is a plain text format for writing *structured* documents. It uses non-alphabetic characters to indicate simple styling choices. The simple syntax makes it easy to read in its raw format and converts easily to a formatted HTML document.

### GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

GitHub Flavored Markdown, aka GFM, is a dialect of Markdown. It uses  the same syntax as Markdown with some additional features, e.g., direct embedding of HTML.

#### Basic Syntax
```markdown
h1 - h6 head tags
# = h1, ## = h2, etc.

**text** = bold
*text* = italic

[link text](absolute or relative url)

![image path](absolute or relative url)

```
